questions: 

1) Zero seats included, users of PAt cannot be on the free plan they must buy the $9 per month plan

2) $599 Plan



Trainers clients pay the same as a regular Pat user, just the free tier does not qualify for the mentor program. The Regular Pat user can use the free version which will run out of tokens fast



Question 3: This is a HiPat feature for regular individual users and mentors. It is NOT johns inner circle. If the user Steve leaves John as a mentor and they are on the inner circle program, its stays with the user. All that happens is if John referred steve into HiPat weather Steve was being mentored by John or not, John still gets the referral fee from the monthly obligation from only the $29, and $49 plans and john can still receive his referrals for brining in new clients
