## ADD SECTION: How Client Access Works

Explain the difference between Starter and Growth/Pro:

**STARTER PLAN:**
1. Client joins on FREE tier
2. Client sees: "To join [Mentor]'s program, upgrade to a paid plan"
3. Client chooses and pays: $9 (reloadable) / $29/mo / $49/mo
4. Client joins mentor's program

**GROWTH & PRO PLANS:**
1. Client joins on FREE tier
2. Client automatically gets $9 worth of tokens (funded by mentor)
3. Client uses tokens for "Ask Pat" AI queries
4. When tokens run out, client tops up: $9 reload / $29 unlimited / $49 Circle

## ADD SECTION: FAQ (Accordion Style)

**Q: Do my clients have to pay?**
A: Depends on your plan. On Starter, clients pay for their own Pat subscription ($9+). On Growth and Pro, you fund their initial tokens ($7 or $5 per seat), and they top up when empty.

**Q: What happens when a client's tokens run out?**
A: They can reload $9, upgrade to unlimited ($29), or join Circle ($49). Logging and workouts still work - just AI queries pause.

**Q: How do referral fees work?**
A: You earn ongoing fees when clients you referred subscribe to Plus ($29) or Circle ($49). Basic ($9) doesn't generate referrals. You keep earning even if they leave your program.

**Q: What is "Join My Circle"?**
A: Pat's beta program. Circle members ($49/mo) get early features and can earn income by referring others. It's a Pat feature - stays with the user, not tied to any mentor.

**Q: What's included in a "seat"?**
A: On Growth/Pro, each seat gives your client $9 worth of AI tokens. You pay $7 (Growth) or $5 (Pro) per seat - you're saving $2-$4 per client while funding their access.

## Developer Notes

### Token System Logic

```typescript
// Define token value (DEVELOPER MUST SET)
const TOKENS_PER_DOLLAR = ???;  // How many tokens = $1

// Seat token allocation
const SEAT_TOKEN_VALUE = 9;  // All plans give $9 worth of tokens

// When client attaches to mentor
function attachClientToMentor(clientId, mentorId, mentorPlan) {
  if (mentorPlan === 'starter') {
    // Client must upgrade themselves
    if (clientPlan === 'free') {
      showUpgradePrompt(clientId, {
        message: "To join this mentor's program, choose your plan:",
        options: ['$9 Basic', '$29 Plus', '$49 Circle']
      });
      return;
    }
  } else {
    // Growth/Pro/Enterprise - allocate tokens
    const tokens = SEAT_TOKEN_VALUE * TOKENS_PER_DOLLAR;
    allocateTokens(clientId, tokens);
  }
  createMentorClientRelationship(clientId, mentorId);
}

// When tokens run out
function onTokensEmpty(clientId) {
  showTopUpPrompt(clientId, {
    message: "Your included tokens have run out.",
    options: [
      { price: 9, label: '$9 - Reload tokens', type: 'reload' },
      { price: 29, label: '$29/mo - Unlimited', type: 'plus' },
      { price: 49, label: '$49/mo - Circle', type: 'circle' }
    ]
  });
}
```

### Data Models Needed

```typescript
interface MentorSubscription {
  mentorId: string;
  plan: 'starter' | 'growth' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
  includedSeats: number;       // 0, 20, 100, custom
  overagePerSeat: number;      // 9, 7, 5, custom
  currentSeatCount: number;
}

interface ClientTokenAccount {
  userId: string;
  mentorId?: string;
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'basic' | 'plus' | 'circle';
  tokenBalance: number;
  isUnlimited: boolean;        // true for Plus/Circle
}
```
