## KEY VALUE PROPOSITION (Use This Messaging Throughout)

**"Hire Pat as Your 24/7 Assistant"**

The mentor program is designed so that:
- **You hire Pat** - Pat is your AI employee that works 24/7 for your clients
- **You pay for the tools** ($99/$199/$599) - Access to HiPat dashboard, directives, analytics
- **You pay per seat** ($9/$7/$5) - Hiring Pat to serve each of your clients
- **You keep 100% of what you charge** - Whatever you charge your clients for YOUR programs, coaching, training is YOUR revenue. Pat doesn't take a cut.

**Analogy:** It's like hiring a virtual assistant. You pay their salary (seat cost), they work for your business, and your client revenue is yours to keep.

## ADD SECTION: FAQ (Accordion Style)

**Q: Do I take a cut of what mentors charge their clients?**
A: No. You keep 100% of your coaching revenue. You're hiring Pat as your assistant - you pay Pat's "salary" (the seat cost), and your client fees are your business.

**Q: What's the difference between Starter and Growth/Pro?**
A: On Starter, your clients hire Pat themselves (they pay $9+). On Growth/Pro, YOU hire Pat for your clients ($7 or $5/seat) - it's included as part of your service to them.

**Q: What happens when a client's tokens run out?**
A: They can reload $9, upgrade to unlimited ($29), or join Circle ($49). Logging and workouts still work - just AI queries pause.

**Q: How do referral fees work?**
A: You earn ongoing fees when clients you referred subscribe to Plus ($29) or Circle ($49). Basic ($9) doesn't generate referrals. You keep earning even if they leave your program.

**Q: What is "Join My Circle"?**
A: Pat's beta program. Circle members ($49/mo) get early features and can earn income by referring others. It's a Pat feature - stays with the user, not tied to any mentor.

**Q: What's included in a "seat"?**
A: A seat is hiring Pat to serve one client. On Growth/Pro, you pay $7 or $5 to hire Pat, and Pat gives your client $9 worth of AI access. It's like getting a discount on your assistant's services.

## Developer Notes

### Token System Logic

```typescript
// Define token value (DEVELOPER MUST SET)
const TOKENS_PER_DOLLAR = ???;  // How many tokens = $1

// Seat token allocation
const SEAT_TOKEN_VALUE = 9;  // All plans give $9 worth of tokens

// When client attaches to mentor
function attachClientToMentor(clientId, mentorId, mentorPlan) {
  if (mentorPlan === 'starter') {
    // Client must upgrade themselves
    if (clientPlan === 'free') {
      showUpgradePrompt(clientId, {
        message: "To join this mentor's program, choose your plan:",
        options: ['$9 Basic', '$29 Plus', '$49 Circle']
      });
      return;
    }
  } else {
    // Growth/Pro/Enterprise - allocate tokens
    const tokens = SEAT_TOKEN_VALUE * TOKENS_PER_DOLLAR;
    allocateTokens(clientId, tokens);
  }
  createMentorClientRelationship(clientId, mentorId);
}

// When tokens run out
function onTokensEmpty(clientId) {
  showTopUpPrompt(clientId, {
    message: "Your included tokens have run out.",
    options: [
      { price: 9, label: '$9 - Reload tokens', type: 'reload' },
      { price: 29, label: '$29/mo - Unlimited', type: 'plus' },
      { price: 49, label: '$49/mo - Circle', type: 'circle' }
    ]
  });
}
```

### Data Models Needed

```typescript
interface MentorSubscription {
  mentorId: string;
  plan: 'starter' | 'growth' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
  includedSeats: number;       // 0, 20, 100, custom
  overagePerSeat: number;      // 9, 7, 5, custom
  currentSeatCount: number;
}

interface ClientTokenAccount {
  userId: string;
  mentorId?: string;
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'basic' | 'plus' | 'circle';
  tokenBalance: number;
  isUnlimited: boolean;        // true for Plus/Circle
}
```

## Summary Table

| Mentor Plan | You Pay to Hire Pat | Client Gets | Your Revenue |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Starter $99 | $0 (client hires Pat) | — | Keep 100% of your fees |
| Growth $199 | $7/seat | $9 in AI tokens | Keep 100% of your fees |
| Pro $599 | $5/seat | $9 in AI tokens | Keep 100% of your fees |
